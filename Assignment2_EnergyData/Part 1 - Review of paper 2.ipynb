    "# A review of artificial intelligence based building energy use prediction: \n",
    "# Contrasting the capabilities of single and ensemble prediction models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "Population growth and economic development in many ways propelled energy and material consumption to a greater degree that \n",
    "threatens the very existence of our Earth. So people are trying to find new ways to efficiently manage energy consumption. \n",
    "This has led to use of many technologies and creation of simulation tools to reduce predict and also reduce energy consumption. \n",
    "Many researches have started using AI technologies in the recent decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Current trends: AI-based building energy use prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper takes into consideration the recent research studies (2011-2016) and gives us a summary of the current trends in AI \n",
    "based models and techniques for predicting energy uses. A total of 35 studies were narrowed down. The selection criteria for \n",
    "narrowing recent work included the building types, prediction approaches, energy output types predicted, time scale of the \n",
    "prediction, and input data types used for prediction. These factors are described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Building Type\n",
    "There were four primary categories of buildings used in the studies:\n",
    "1. Educational and research (42% of studies)\n",
    "2. Commercial Building (33% of studies)\n",
    "3. Residential (17% of studies)\n",
    "4. Other(8% of studies)\n",
    "The percentage of first two categories is higher because of the availability of data. The data from residential building can \n",
    "also be collected easily using sensors but it’s not feasible based on the privacy concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Prediction Methods\n",
    "Various AI-based energy prediction models were proposed in the reviewed articles. According to the model structure and the number of the prediction models used, these models may be classified into two categories: single and ensemble prediction models. 91% of the studies used single prediction algorithm and 9% of the studies used ensemble models. This is due to the fact that the framework of applying AI-based models to building energy use is well established and being used from the year 2000 and the use of the ensemble methods to building energy use is more recent and started in 2014.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Energy Type\n",
    "Based on the level of detail, the predicted energy type may be classified into the following five categories:\n",
    "1. Whole building energy(57% of studies)\n",
    "2. Heating and cooling energy(11% of studies)\n",
    "3. Heating energy(11% of studies)\n",
    "4. Cooling energy(13% of studies)\n",
    "5. Other(8% of studies)\n",
    "Some studies considered heating and cooling specifically because that’s the majority of energy usage in the buildings considered\n",
    "for these studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Prediction time scale\n",
    "Prediction time scale represents the time resolution of the prediction which is often impacted by the sampling interval of \n",
    "sensors\n",
    "and the purpose of the research. Our review showed that various prediction time scales. The following 4 categories can be used to describe time scales used in different studies:\n",
    "1. Hour(49% of studies)\n",
    "2. Year(8% of studies)\n",
    "3. Day(19% of studies)\n",
    "4. Other(24% of studies)\n",
    "Almost 49% of studies used Hourly timely scale to predict energy usage indicating that such scale is capable of satisfying the \n",
    "needs of current studies. Only few researches were focused on long term energy usage prediction,\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Input data type\n",
    "Selecting highly correlated input data is crucial for AI-based building energy use prediction. The literature review showed \n",
    "that researchers collected input data based on their knowledge of the prediction model and the availability of the data. \n",
    "Since the experimental condition varies in different studies, various input features have been selected to work as the input \n",
    "data for AI-based prediction models.\n",
    "Based on the type of input data, the authors classify them into three categories as follows:\n",
    "1. Meteorological data(60% of studies)\n",
    "    (e.g.: outdoor temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation and solar radiation)\n",
    "2. Occupancy data(29% of studies)\n",
    "    (e.g.: day occupancy, night occupancy, patterns of occupancy)\n",
    "3. Others(54% of studies)\n",
    "It should be noted that multiple types of data can be considered to conduct the prediction. The higher percentage of meteorological data is because of the easy availability of sensors. The occupancy data is on a lower side mainly because of privacy reasons and availability of occupancy sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. AI-based prediction models\n",
    "AI-based prediction method consists of four main steps: data collection, data preprocessing, model training, and model testing.\n",
    "The first step is to acquire historical input and output data. The prediction accuracy of AI-based prediction model highly \n",
    "depends on the selection of input data. In general, most influential and highly correlated input data may bring better prediction\n",
    "results.The second step is data preprocessing that is performed on the collected data to organize them in a suitable format \n",
    "before they are used to train the AI-based prediction model. Data preprocessing techniques such as data transformation, data \n",
    "normalization, and data interpolation may be applied in this step to improve the data quality.The third step is to -train the \n",
    "AI-based prediction model. Since the key concept of the AI-based prediction method is learning from historical data, a training\n",
    "process is required to develop the model. More specifically, the training process aims to select the most appropriate parameters that improve the prediction performance of the learning algorithm. Notably, the type of parameters varies between different learning algorithms. The parameter selections are impacted by various factors such as the size of training data, the selection of input variables, and the performance indicators.\n",
    "The fourth step is to validate the prediction performance of the model by applying the testing data to the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Single prediction models\n",
    "The single prediction method refers to the prediction system which is formed based on one prediction algorithm. In this paper, \n",
    "the scope of single prediction method covers all available AI-based prediction models, i.e., MLR, ANN, and SVR. Consequently, \n",
    "this method may be subdivided into several types based on their applied learning algorithms. For this paper, they primarily \n",
    "focused on the algorithms that are employed in the field of AI-based building energy use prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Ensemble prediction method\n",
    "In machine learning, ensemble model is defined as an approach using multiple learning algorithms/models to obtain better \n",
    "predictive performance than that could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms/models. Rather than a \n",
    "prediction algorithm, ensemble model works as a framework which aims to provide the best possible prediction performance \n",
    "by automatically managing the strengths and weaknesses of each base model. The weight of each base model is assigned based on \n",
    "its prediction accuracy, which means that the one with the least prediction errors may have the highest weight. Ensemble \n",
    "prediction models may be further classified into two types as follows:\n",
    "    1. Homogeneous ensemble models: The homogeneous ensemble model uses the same base learner on different distributions of\n",
    "        the training set i.e.bagging and boosting. \n",
    "        \n",
    "<img src=\"p1.JPG\">\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Heterogeneous ensemble models: The heterogeneous ensemble model comprises of different learning models which are\n",
    "       trained by the same data set.\n",
    "      \n",
    "<img src=\"p2.JPG\">\n",
    "    \n",
    "### 4. Conclusion:\n",
    "The advantages of the single prediction method are reliability, ease of implementation and fast computation speed. The \n",
    "disadvantages include limited prediction accuracy and reliability, particularly when compared to the ensemble prediction method;\n",
    "and that the users need to select a suitable learning algorithm for their problems as no one particular algorithm has dominated \n",
    "the others in predicting building energy use for all cases.The advantage of the ensemble prediction method lies in its remarkably\n",
    "improved prediction accuracy and stability. Since it uses multiple base models to predict the results, the irrelevance among \n",
    "these base models will reduce the overall prediction error of the system. Similarly, as the prediction results are made based\n",
    "on the integration of the base models, it is unlikely that all the base models would fail to predict properly at the same time.\n",
    "Comparing with single prediction method, ensemble prediction method requires more calculation time and high level of knowledge \n",
    "as it is the combination of different base models. Another drawback of the ensemble prediction method is the fact that its \n",
    "prediction performance highly depends on the selection of base models.\n",
